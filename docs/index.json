You can reference page resources by the value for Resources.GetMatch or the filepath of the resource relative to the page directory directly. Store resources in the assets directory, which is /assets by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the assets directory. Store resources in the static directory, which is /static by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the static directory. The priority of references is also in the above order. There are many places in the theme where the above local resource references can be used, such as links, images, image shortcode, music shortcode and some params in the front matter. Images in page resources or assets directory processing will be supported in the future. It’s really cool!
